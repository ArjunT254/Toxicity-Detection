# GameGuardian: Toxicity Recognition from Chat

## Overview

Welcome to GameGuardian, a powerful tool designed to recognize toxicity in player chat data. This project utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Deep Learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By harnessing the capabilities of these cutting-edge technologies, GameGuardian achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 87% in sentiment classification, effectively identifying and flagging toxic messages within gaming communities.

## Features

- **Toxicity Detection**: GameGuardian employs state-of-the-art NLP models to analyze and classify player chat data, distinguishing between toxic and non-toxic messages.
- **Multi-Emotion Recognition**: In addition to detecting toxicity, GameGuardian can identify a range of human emotions, including Joy, Fear, Anger, Love, Sadness, and Surprise, enhancing the understanding of player sentiment.
- **Streamlit Web Application**: The project is packaged as a user-friendly Streamlit web application, making it easy to interact with and deploy for real-time toxicity monitoring.
